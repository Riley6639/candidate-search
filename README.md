## development
This was my first expierience using typescript and react. To develop this project I had to first create an interface type for the candidate data, and then create the react components to handle and display that data. I also had to use the useContext hook to share the data between components. By using this hook I was able to get the data from the saved candidates to the other component so they could render that list.
